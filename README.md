# Drum_kit

[Live Demo 🚀](https://drum-kit-seven-gilt.vercel.app/)

This mini project is a simple web-based drum kit application. It allows users to play different drum sounds by either clicking on buttons or pressing specific keys on their keyboard.

Working on this mini project provided a hands-on experience with web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML: You learned how to structure a web page using HTML elements such as headings, tables, buttons, and footers. You also practiced linking external CSS and JavaScript files to your HTML document.

CSS: You gained experience in styling web page elements using CSS. This included setting background colors, fonts, and text alignment, as well as applying styles to buttons and adding background images.

JavaScript: You enhanced your JavaScript skills by adding interactivity to the web page. You learned how to add event listeners to detect user interactions, play audio files, and manipulate the DOM to create visual effects.

Overall, this project helped you understand the basics of creating an interactive web application and improved your proficiency in front-end web development technologies.
